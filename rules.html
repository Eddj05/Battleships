    <h2> Rules</h2>
    <p>
        Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically.
        The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of ship.
        The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid).
        The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player.
        After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds.
        In each round, each player takes a turn to click on a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at.
        When there is a boat on that square, this will be announced.
        When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship's owner announces the sinking of the Battleship, specifying which Battleship it was.
        If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.
        Good luck playing the game!
